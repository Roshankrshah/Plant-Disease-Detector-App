# Plant-Disease-Detector-App

Motivation
In India about 70% of the populace relies on agriculture. Identification of the 
plant diseases is important in order to prevent the losses within the yield. It's 
terribly troublesome to observe the plant diseases manually. It needs tremendous 
quantity of labour, expertise within the plant diseases, and conjointly need the 
excessive time interval. Hence, image processing and machine learning models 
can be employed for the detection of plant diseases.

In this project, we have described the technique for the detection of plant diseases 
with the help of their leafâ€™s pictures.

Dataset
We have used public dataset for plant leaf disease detection called 
Plant Village.The dataset consists of 87000 RGB images of healthy and unhealthy 
plant leaves having 38 classes.
The images cover 14 species of crops, including: apple, blueberry, cherry, grape, 
orange, peach, pepper, potato, raspberry, soy, squash, strawberry and tomato. It 
contains images of 17 basic diseases, 4 bacterial diseases, 2 diseases caused by 
mold (oomycete), 2 viral diseases and 1 disease caused by a mite. 12 crop species 
also have healthy leaf images that are not visibly affected by disease.
